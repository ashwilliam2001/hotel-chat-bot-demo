# Hotel Chatbot Project

Welcome to the Hotel Chatbot Project! This web-based application allows hotels to manage customer service efficiently using a chatbot system. The project provides three types of user interfaces: one for customers, one for hotel staff, and one for admins.

## Features

- **Customer Chat Interface**: Customers can place orders through the chatbot system, which are linked to their room and booking number.
- **Staff Dashboard**: Hotel staff can view customer orders, manage their status, and mark them as completed.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can monitor all activities, track orders, and oversee the overall system.

## Tech Stack
